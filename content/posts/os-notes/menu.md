Notes for [周志遠作業系統](https://ocw.nthu.edu.tw/ocw/index.php?page=course&cid=141)  
Most of the content are just text version of the slides at [the slide link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C1s3j0nO8jo57BqBmgS55AoL_LoJr-cr). The images are from the text book and the slides.  
The order of the chapters follows the teacher's teaching sequence, not the numerical order.
